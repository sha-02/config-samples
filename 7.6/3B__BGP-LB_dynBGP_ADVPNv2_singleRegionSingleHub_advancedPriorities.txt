Single Region WEST
Single Hub WEST-DC1
EAST-BR1 becomes WEST-BR3

BGP on loobpack
dynamic BGP for shorcuts
Hub-side steering BGP priority from priority in per-overlay Branch SD-WAN probes
  . no SDWAN rule on Hub, Hub-side steering is solely based on Branches' priorities
  . Different strategies are used by each Branch
    . WEST-BR1: "lowest cost" INET1, INET2, MPLS        (in-sla 1,2,3 ; out-sla 4,5,6)
    . WEST-BR2: LB between INET1/INET2/MPLS             (in-sla 1,1,1 ; out-sla 2,2,2)
    . WEST-BR3: LB between INET1/INET2, fallback MPLS   (in-sla 1,1,2 ; out-sla 3,3,4)
 
no CORE signaling since there is a single Hub
