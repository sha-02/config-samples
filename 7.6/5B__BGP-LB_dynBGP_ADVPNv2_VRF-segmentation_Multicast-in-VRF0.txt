BGP on loobpack
dynamic BGP for shorcuts
Hub-side steering BGP priority from priority in per-overlay Branch SD-WAN probes
CORE signaling 7.6-style = Hub re-enforces MED to CORE based on the MED received from the Branch
VRF segmentation (origin can be NATed)

Multicast in BLUE VRF
  . static IP for overlays
  . 7.4-style: 
     . PE VRF and BLUE VRF are forced to VRF 0
     . WAN VRF (Internet +MPLS overlays) is forced to VRF 1 (unlike PE VRF 0 to avoid configuring VRF leaking -- SNAT not possible in VRF 0)
