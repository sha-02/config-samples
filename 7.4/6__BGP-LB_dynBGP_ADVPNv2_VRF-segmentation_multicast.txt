BGP on loobpack
dynamic BGP for shorcuts
Hub-side steering BGP priority from SLA metrics in per-overlay Branch SD-WAN probes
CORE signaling = Hub sends MED to CORE based on the community received from the Branch
VRF segmentation (origin can be NATed)

Multicast in BLUE VRF
  . static IP for overlays
  . PE VRF and BLUE VRF are forced to VRF 0
  . WAN VRF (Internet +MPLS overlays) is forced to VRF 1 (unlike PE VRF 0 to avoid configuring VRF leaking -- SNAT not possible in VRF 0)
